<!-- <h3>About me</h3> -->
<p>
  I'm Alex Mason, <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskeller</a> by day (and by night),
  currently working for <a href="https://data61.csiro.au">Data61</a>,
  a part of the <a href="https://www.csiro.au">CSIRO</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I'm the founding organiser of the Canberra Functional Programming Group,
  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CanFPG">CanFP</a>, and have run the AusHac
  Haskell hackathons in <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/AusHac2011">2011</a>
  and <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/AusHac2012">2012</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I currently work on the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/">AREMI</a>, the
  Australia Renewable Energy Mapping Infrastructure, building backend
  services in Haskell for geospatial data. The frontend for AREMI is
  <a href="http://github.com/NICTA/aremi-natmap">open source</a> and based
  on <a href="http://terria.io">TerriaJS</a>, an open source geospatial mapping
  framework written at Data61. The services I've built will be made open source
  soon!
</p>
<p>
  I studied at the Australian
  National University, with a focus on scientific and high performance computing,
  use Haskell throughout, but also plenty of Java, C, Ada, Python and assembly for
  various ISAs.
